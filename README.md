This software is open source, works as a WAF module in Nginx web server, and it provides 
a lightweight and restful framework for us to look into the content of requests from clients.

It can defend amount of attacks, such as COMMAND/XSS/SQL/HEADER injection,
upload file attack, slow HTTP DOS, hash consistency attack, etc.
    
Also, it provides an effective way to monitor the Nginx web server in real time,
supports IP whitelists and blacklists, and works with log system for further study.
